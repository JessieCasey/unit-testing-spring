| `1` | `Monica`  | `Geller` | `1994-10-11`         | 
| `2` | `Ross`    | `Geller` | `1990-11-15`         |

Let's try to send the request to the endpoint.

`http://localhost:8080/api/users/{id}`

```
{
    "id": 1,
    "firstname": "Monica",
    "lastname": "Geller",
    "birthday": "1994-10-11",
    "age": 28
}
```

```
{
    "statusCode": 400,
    "timestamp": "2023-03-06T15:51:06.413+00:00",
    "message": "The user with id: [100] does not exist",
    "request": "uri=/api/users/100"
